# facebook unban members

Use PyQt4 and webkit to navigate facebook interface and unban members one by
one, a crawler.

Simple project, there is a pattern, I am planning to setup a framework later on.

There is a bug, when clicking "Remove block" sometimes the
confirmation dialog failed to show up, restarting the program probably
needed to recover.
